// One instrument, so that two projects cannot disagree about a number.
//
// This file exists because of a rule and a scar. The rule is that a number
// needs a method, and the method needs to be calibrated -- a threshold in a
// test and a reading in a tuning session have to mean the same thing, or they
// are worse than having neither. The scar is that three separate "bugs" turned
// out to be measurement error, and one of them was a pitch detector living in
// a test file's anonymous namespace where nothing could check it against a
// signal of known pitch. It reported 294.7 Hz for a 440 Hz tone and a fix was
// carried all the way through before anyone suspected the instrument.
//
// A detector that is only used by the suite that defines it is a detector
// nobody has calibrated. So they live here, they are tested against synthetic
// signals whose answers are known in advance, and everything that needs a
// number asks the same code.
//
// This is the only header in the library with a dependency: `integratedLufs`
// delegates to libebur128 rather than implementing BS.1770, for the reason
// given at that function. It is why measurement is a SEPARATE TARGET --
// `chalkwalk::dsp::measure` -- and not part of the header-only primitives. A
// consumer that wants a filter does not link a loudness meter.
//
// JUCE-free and allocation-light, so it compiles into a headless test target
// and into a console tool without dragging anything behind it.
